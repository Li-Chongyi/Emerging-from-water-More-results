Emerging from Water: Underwater Image Color Correction Based on Weakly Supervised Color Transfer

Chongyi Li, Jichang Guo, Chunle Guo


This folder includes the 30 raw underwater images, the resutls of different methods, and the corresponding visual quality scores provided by 10 participants. Besides, we display these resutls in the Supplementary_Materials.pdf for comparisons.  

For the user study, the results of different methods were randomly displayed on the screen and compared with the corresponding raw underwater images. After that, we invited 10 participants who had experience with image processing to score results. There was no time limitation for each participant. Moreover, the participants did not know which results were
produced by our method. The scores ranged from 1 (worst) to 8 (best). As baseline, we set the scores of raw underwater images to 3. We expected the good result has high contrast and visibility, abundant details, in especial the color as if the image was taken without the water. On the contrary, the bad result has low visibility, over-enhanced regions, serious artifacts and noise, and inauthentic color.
